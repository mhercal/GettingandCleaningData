# Coursera getting and cleaning data project

This repository includes:

- One R script called `run_analysis.R` that does the following. 

  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each      activity and each subject.

- A tidy data set called `tidy_data.txt` containing the results of the R script above.
- A code book called `CodeBook.md` explaining how `run_analysis.R` works and the variables it uses.

This R script assumes the user has downloaded the data, and has it storaged in his working directory without altering the name of the folder or documents include in the data archive.
